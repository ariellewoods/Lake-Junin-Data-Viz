# Lake-Junin-Data-Viz

Below are examples of plots and figures generated during my PhD work, which focused on sediment records from Lake Junin - a large lake in the Peruvian Andes that is over 1 million years old.

This work is ongoing and has been featured so far in Nature Comms, Science, and other journals.

This figure showcases select proxy data from Lake Junin, along with several important climatic records from tropical and polar regions, highlighting the impact of abrupt temperature changes in Greenland on monsoon strength in the Andes during the last 50,000 years.

Sediment core images can be imported into R and plotted alongside corresponding proxy data to interpret changes in sedimentology.

Differences in sediment composition, as well as the correlation between oxygen and carbon isotopes, can be used to infer changes in lake level and hydrology.
